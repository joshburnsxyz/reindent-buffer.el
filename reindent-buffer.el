;;; Commentary:

;; This plugin provides a command that will (regardless of major-mode) 
;; mark the whole buffer and run the indent-region command. Automatically
;; reformatting the contents in relation to how the major mode and your
;; other settings like tab-stops etc. are setup.

;;; Code:

(defun reindent-buffer ()
  "Mark whole buffer, then indent the region."
  (interactive)
  (save-excursion
    (indent-region (point-min) (point-max) nil)))

(provide reindent-buffer)
;;; reindent-buffer.el ends here
